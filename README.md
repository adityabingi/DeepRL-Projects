# Udacity-DRLND

My tensorflow 2.0 implementations  of RL and DeepRL projects and solutions to the exercises from open-source repo of Udacity DeepRL Nanodegree.I worked
myself through the Udacity DeepRL projects and I suggest anyone with knowledge of RL and Deep Learning to experiment with these open-source probelm exercises 
and projects.Although Udacity repo is based on pytorch I implement all the projects and exercise solutions in Tensorflow 2.0
